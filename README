This repository contains the (EXPERIMENTAL) script files to migrate
Fuse - the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator ([1]) from Subversion to Git.

It is needed Reposurgeon ([2]) for the migration, currently at version 3.29.

The process is:
  1) Type `make' for converting the repository.
  2) Type `make gc' to repack the repository before submitting to a server.

To speed up the process, download the Subversion repository to a local
directory and modify the REMOTE_URL variable in Makefile:

    rsync -av svn.code.sf.net::p/fuse-emulator/code .

The file tickets_map.txt contains a map for translating tickets numbers from
the old bug tracking system to the new one (Allura). It has been build by:

    svn log | grep -o -E "#[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]+" | sort | uniq | \
        xargs -I{} ticket2allura.sh {} >> tickets_map.txt

but some misspelled tickets have been fixed with info from the mailing lists. 

The file fuse-emulator.map contains the contributor map.

The file fuse-emulator.lift has commands used by reposurgeon to tidy up
the repository.
